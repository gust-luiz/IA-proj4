## Convolutional Neural Network: Exploring handwritten digits identificationmanuscritos
The MNIST database contains handwritten digits records from 0 to 9, 70000 total. A Convolutional Neural Network should be trained using this database to identify all digits. The implemention must be over [Keras](https://keras.io/) framework.

Beyond that, there are questions to be explore, such as:

1. How a normalized data influences the results?

2. What is the cross validation impact over the results, considering 70/30 and 90/10 rates?

3. What is the convolutional layers impact over the results, considering 1, 2 and 3 convolutional layers?

[See full project description](ref/proj4r-iia-1-2020.pdf).

### Solution
Developed on [Python 3.8.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-385/) and you can run it as follow:

```
# Activate your virtual environment
python src/main.py
```
